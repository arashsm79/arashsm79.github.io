Adobe Connect does not have a native Linux client and its web app does not allow you to share your screen in a webinar.
You could use Wine or a VM to install the native client and share your screen that way, but that's just way too much of a hassle.

{% highlight shell %}
flatpak install obs
{% endhighlight %}
